Humans can discriminate trillions of olfactory stimuli, or more, or fewer
========

Analysis of the data in "Humans can discriminate more than 1 trillion olfactory stimuli" [[1]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24653035).

Used for publication of Gerkin and Castro, 2015, in ArXiV queue.  

All analysis is shown in arxiv.ipynb and can be re-executed interactively.  

Aa read-only view is shown in arxiv.html and also [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rgerkin/trillion/blob/master/arxiv.ipynb).  

trillion.py is the module containing most of the analysis code not defined explicitly in arxiv.ipynb.
